grunt-magic
===========

This is the repository for the sample file used in my book Lean websites for Chapter 4 - Bootcamp.

If you want more info on this repo, please check out my previous blog post http://wp.me/p2cJg-9L (the links in the blog post reference to an earlier version of the grunt-magic test).

This repo is supposed to illustrate how you can use grunt to automatically optimize your front-end deployment.

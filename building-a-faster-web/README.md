Building a faster web
=============

Resources for my performance workshop - Building a faster web.

## Requirements
 The Chrome web browser is required to perform each exercise within the workshop. The correct version for your operating system can be downloaded and installed from: [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)

For some of the more advanced tasks, Node.js is required to run the JavaScript based task runner Grunt. You can download the latest version of Node.js for your operating system [here](http://nodejs.org/)
 
Once you have Node installed you can install Grunt globally. From your terminal command line type: **npm install grunt-cli -g**

## Running
 To run the slides open this folder in your terminal and change directory into the "slides‚Äù folder: **cd slides**.

Now simply run **grunt serve** to start running the slide server. You can now access them in your browser at: **http://localhost:8000**.

To run the exercise tasks simply open up the **tasks/start.html** file in your browser directly.

## Questions and feedback
 To get the most from the workshop it's extremely important that you ask questions if you get stuck, need help or want something explained in more depth. Please feel free to do this at any time during the slides or exercise time.

Above all, have fun!
